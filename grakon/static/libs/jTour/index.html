<h2>jTour is a multipage website tour engine designed by Ben Martin Studios.</h2>
<p class="sub">Take a look at some of the features below, complete with working demos and examples!




<div class="section themes">

<div>
<h3>Four Themes!</h3>
<p>jTour comes standard with four themes; white (default), black, yellow, and blue. With just minimal knowledge of CSS, you can even make your own!</p>
<p>Take the <a href="#jTour/themes" class="jtour">jTour Theme demo</a> to see each of the themes in action.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section scrolling">

<div>
<h3>Smart Scrolling</h3>
<p>If the next tour item is to be placed off screen, jTour will automatically scroll to the correct position. But it doesn't just scroll; you can make it scroll intelligently by setting scroll offsets, so that a tour item always shows a certain amount of pixels from the top of the screen.</p>

<div>
<h3>Multipage Tours</h3>
<p>Be it tours that span more than one page, or multiple tours all on the same page, jTour can do the job. Multipage tour support was the prime reason behind the creation of jTour, the original multipage tour engine.</p>

<div class="section spotlight">
<img src="img/im7.png" width="300" height="200"/>
<div>
<h3>Spotlights On</h3>
<p>Using the spotlight feature, you can put the spotlight on an element to draw your viewer's attention straight to it. Spotlight can draw attention to any element on the page, not just the one that the tour item is positioned relative to.</p>
<p>To see how the spotlight feature grabs your focus, try out the <a href="#jTour/spotlight" class="jtour">jTour Spotlight demo</a>.</p>

<div class="section">

<div>
<h3>Powerful API/Callback Functions</h3>
<p>jTour has a very simple and yet powerful API. You can interact with the tour while it is playing, or you can set callbacks for certain events in the tour or even for a specific tour item. You can play/pause/stop the tour, set callbacks for tour/tour item start & finish, and even set step callbacks for a particular tour item.</p>
<p>jTour supports up to 100 step callbacks (1 for each percentage the item is completed) for each tour item, or you can even bind a single function to repeat as long as the tour item is playing.</p>
<p>It's all up to you; jTour's capable and yet easy to use API gives you maximum control over your tours.</p>

<div>
<h3>Keyboard & Mouse Control</h3>
<p>jTour has an easy-to-use UI, but in case controlling the tour with your mouse is not quite your users style, it supports keyboard control also. You don't have to pick - it handles both at the same time - and with keyboard shortcuts displayed as tooltips above the button controls, the end user can figure out which key does what in no time!</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="section positions">
<img src="img/im2.png" width="300" height="200"/>
<div>
<h3>81+ Positions</h3>
<p>Each step of the tour has a box that shows a message with an optional title. The box is positioned in relation to an element selected with a jQuery selector. There are 9 positions for the anchor point of the tour box, and there are 9 positions for the position on the element to anchor the tour box to. For each, you can choose from: top-left, top-centre, top-right, centre-left, centre-centre, centre-right, bottom-left, bottom-centre, or bottom-right.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can also set vertical and horizontal offsets for each box, ultimately allowing you an unlimited number of positions resulting in pixel perfect placement of a tour box. jTour even gives you the option to overwrite the precise positioning and keep the tour box entirely on the page (just in case your viewer has a small browser window!).</p>
